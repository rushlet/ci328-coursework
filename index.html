		<h1>Don't Panic</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			It is your mission to navigate through outer space, collecting coins and avoiding alien abductions - they could be <a href="https://youtu.be/cbN1NaQ7yQI?t=2s" target="_blank">Vogons trying to find an unsuspecting audience for their abominable poetry</a>.<br />
			Like the Heart of Gold, the rocket has an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCf53ses22w" target="_blank">Infinite Improbability Drive</a> - when it's ready to be activated, it will appear in the bottom right hand corner. Clicking on it might
			cause anything from regeneration into a different galaxy to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCsfHVM5x_I" target="_blank">a whale being spontaneously called into existence</a>.</p>
		<h2>How To Play</h2>
